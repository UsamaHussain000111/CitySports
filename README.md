I made this site in my university database project. Currently improving it during my free time. The main objective was to build server side logic and back end.
For employers :
It is made using Apache server, PHP. JQuery, AJAX and bootstrap. It is browser compatible and responsive to both mobile and desktop.
Functionalities include : Showing products from database, Adding products to cart, remove products from cart, updating cart, search products.
Currently working on these functionalities : log in form(with validation), payment method with paypal, confirming orders.
